# ML-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-

This project gave me experience and practice with Support Vector Machines, and my first time automating the parameter search to optimize the model that I used. The dataset is a csv file that has multiple variables that are continuos number values and the output variable is whether the cancer was benign or malignant. I also got to try out more built in functions to speed up my work such as using train_test_split to easily split the data up into training and test sets by whatever fraction i decided. I also learned how to use cross validation score to check that my model isn't too overfitted to my data. This overfitting is necessary because I wouldn't say this data set is too large, and so the training set and test set could be slightly different and would be affected by overfitting of the model.
The models are randomly created each time the script is ran and thus the accuracy of the model fluctuates each time it is run, but typically I get values around 0.88-0.92 +/- 0.03. 

Thus from the values I stated above I believe that this model could be somewhat useful to give initial alerts for the type of cancer and more data or tuning of the parameters would give a greater accuracy.
